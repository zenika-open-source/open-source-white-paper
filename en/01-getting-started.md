# Chapter 1: Getting Started ü•ö

The world of open source is vast, it is very easy to get lost. On New Source, this world publishes little accessible and intimidating. Where to start? Are there rules and codes to follow? How to contribute even if I do not code?
No worries, in this article, we will give you all the necessary codes to start well, choose the right project and offer your first contribution.


## First steps üê£

First of all, you have to decide on which project you want to start your first contribution. Since there are millions of open source projects, it can be difficult to find one's way.

A first idea, which is perhaps the simplest, is **to identify projects that you like, that you use often or that interest you.** It will then be more obvious to start in an environment that you know and on which you will keep motivation in the longer term.

It is also important to take into account the maturity of the project and its size. It is tempting to start on large frameworks, libraries or tools like VS Code, MongoDB, Android, React... These types of projects have many contributors and many bugs to correct or features to achieve. Contributions on these projects bring some satisfaction when they are integrated. But these projects, with millions of lines of code, are not the best choices to start in open source. They will be harder to grasp by their size and the workflows that come with it. Their communities are already well developed and many people are offering contributions for a limited number of maintainers. It can then take a while before your contribution is studied and eventually accepted.

**Starting on smaller projects that have potential is a better way to get started.** To do this, just regularly monitor those who mount, for example on the [GitHub trending](https://github.com/trending/javascript?since=monthly), and find projects that match you.

Another good way to identify a project to participate in is to **select those who are actively looking for contributors.** Several sites and tools can find:

* [Awesome for beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners) is a list of projects looking for contributors (beginners or not) by listing their *"Good First Issues"*. In the same way, the site [Up for grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net) makes it possible to find projects in search of contributors.

* [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) is a tool for subscribing to open source projects and receiving new requests for contributions every day.

* [First contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io/) is a little different, it's a workshop to make your first contribution in less than five minutes. It presents the basis of the git workflow to make contributions on GitHub. In addition to this tutorial, the site offers links to *"Good First Issues"* of large GitHub projects.

* Evenings or community events like [HacktoberFest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) are also a good way to get started on projects looking for contributors. For example, the [hack.commit.push](https://hack-commit-pu.sh/) offers an open source development day, open to everyone, whatever your level. At the beginning of the day, introductory workshops are presented, followed by open source contributions with mentors.

Once you have found the project(s) of your dreams, you will need to start by documenting these projects, for example by reading the README, the Code of Conduct and the Contribution Guide. It is not very long, but necessary before starting a contribution. They will give you the codes, rules and procedures to respect for the consistency and maintenance of the project.

**Code of conduct**

**Most open source projects write a code of conduct.** It allows to define rules and behaviors to adopt or not on the project.

The essential points of this code define the rules to be followed between the participants. Know how to respect different points of view, listen to and accept feedback on their contributions. Potential disagreements are to be expected. Do not take them personally. Sometimes during reviews, it is possible that we do not agree on some decisions or approaches adopted. It is therefore very important to stay professional and respect the code of conduct. Any feedback is good to take and it is during this type of discussion that we learn the most.

**It is also very important to be patient.** Many open source projects are maintained on personal time. It may therefore take some time before his contribution is re-read or accepted.

Here is an example of a code of conduct used by many projects: [*Contributor agreeant*](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). The rules it defines should be applied in both open source and professional projects.

**The contribution guide**

It helps define workflows and ways of coding on the project to understand the standards and expectations of the community. For example :
* How to set up my development environment?
* How to post an issue?
* What are the commit standards?
* What are the expectations on the tests?
* ...

If a contribution does not follow these good practices, it may be rejected even before it has been reviewed. These standards serve to maintain coherence in the project but also to save time for the project maintainers. So to read carefully.

**Join the community**

A project is not limited to documentation and source code. It is also important to understand and interact with the project community. There are different roles in an open source project, the three main ones being:
* The maintainers or core contributors, who are at the origin of the project or have integrated this role following all the contributions they have made.
* Contributors, who participate in the life of the project by offering contributions (documentation, bug fixes...) but also by answering questions or user tickets.
* And users, who will of course use the project but mostly give feedback, post bugs, propose improvements or ask questions on forums.

The means of communication of the community vary according to the projects. It can be a mailing list, a Slack, a Discord or any other tool of the same type. It allows to ask questions, to help define roadmaps, or simply to discuss between enthusiasts.


## First contribution üê•

Now that you have identified a project that interests you and you have read the necessary documentation to get started, you are ready to offer your first contribution.

Above all, know that you do not need to know how to code to contribute to open source projects:
* Do you like to write? Corrects or develops the project documentation.
* Do you master design? Creates the logo or project site.
* Do you like to communicate? Answer questions from the community.

All contributions are good and serve the project. Here is a non-exhaustive list of tasks you can do to help open source projects:

**Documentation**

* Write and correct project documentation;
* translate the documentation.

**Organization**

* Submit bugs or new features;
* answer the issues, file them and close them if necessary;
* answer questions (eg on GitHub, Stack Overflow...).

**Communication**

* Write articles or tutorials;
* organize meetups or conferences on the project;
* communicate on twitter (new releases, contributions...);
* create a design for the project (logo, colors...);
* develop a site for the project.

**Coder**

* Conduct code reviews;
* develop tests;
* automate the project (CI...);
* fix bugs;
* realize new features.

If you do not know where to start, go through the list of open issues on the project. In many projects, some tickets are identified as *"Good First Issues"* or *"Beginner"*. They were identified by the main contributors as simple contributions and good entry points into the project. Also look at "Help needed" categorized tickets waiting for a contributor to take charge.

When you have identified an issue or a ticket on which you wish to contribute, you must position yourself on it. Do not hesitate to ask other contributors for information. Dialogue and exchange are essential to properly start a new contribution. They will guide you towards the expectations of the community, validate a technical solution or identify certain constraints or difficulties.

Before you publish your first contribution, check your code and do not forget the tests before submitting it. Do not hesitate to explain the context and document its contribution. Anything that will help other contributors and maintainers to reread your contribution will be reviewed and integrated more quickly.

Finally, when you have made your first contribution, do not forget to communicate on it and share it to the world on Twitter, Facebook, or your favorite social network.
